# What is this?

A better looking README on your repositories bring more attention to it and make it look more professional. The goal of this repository is to share tools and websites that allow you to make your READMEs look a lot better.


# What is a Profile README?

GitHub now allows you to make a README for your profile! All you have to do is make a repo with your Username. So if your GitHub username is JohnSmith123 you'd make a repo called JohnSmith123. Once you go to that repo you can see in the top right corner a little display like so:

# What Makes a Good README?

A good README catches the eye of the visitor. Attractive images and information about the repo looks a lot better than plain text. A good logo at the top of your README is a great start. Utilizing badges and informative images about the project is a great way to make the README even cleaner.

### Logos

A clean logo for your README is a great start to make your repository look professional. You can make logos with Photoshop, Gimp, or any other Image Processing Software. For GitHub READMEs you are able to utilize HTML formatting using the `align` tag. Below you can find examples of different ways to line up your logo:

**Left Alignment** - This is the default alignment

```html
<img src="link" alt="logo">
```

**Center Alignment** - Center your image

```html
<img src="link" alt="logo" align="center">
```

**Right Alignment** - This may cause formatting issues if you do inside of a text block.

```html
<img src="link" alt="logo" align="right">
```

### Formatting

Clean formatting is key to any good README. If you can utilize a clean format of sections in your README you're guaranteed to make it look good. A good format to follow is a header/logo to do with your project, followed by any badges below that. After you should have an informative section with a paragraph speaking about the project and what it does or tries to acheive. Then an installation/usage section if it's a tool or something to download. Followed by an FAQ and Credits/Contributing section. You can also make a Wiki with GitHub and put most of the information there. 

### Images

Detailed images in a repo help show people passing by what it does and what it looks like. A clean screenshot unobstructed by any other windows apart from those to do with the application is a great way to catch eyes. Make sure its legible and easy to make out what's going on.

You can even embed a `gif` the same way you'd do an Image. This allows you to show some features of your project without needing to link to Youtube or another video sharing site.

You can use Imgur, Dropbox, or even GitHub itself to host your images. In a `.github` folder or `images` folder on your repo, you can add images to link to in your README and GitHub will host+cache them for you!
